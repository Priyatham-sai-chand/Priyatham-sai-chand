### About me 👨‍💻

I am not a cat ! would love to.

I love collaboration and working together. Have started, shared, assisted and been assisted by people all the time along be it youtubers who share valuable information or mentors who guided me to learn and challenge problems. I am a well organized person with productivity playing a major role throughout the day.

I use a number of tools ranging from vim to adobe suite and like to use and build much more in the coming years.
